# Nitrogen Process Registry

This is a very simple distributed process registry used in Nitrogen.
It likely doesn't have many other uses. If you require a more robust
process registry, check out Ulf Wiger's
[GProc](https://github.com/uwiger/gproc).

See the [Nitrogen Project website](http://nitrogenproject.com) for
additional information about Nitrogen.
